# ExpenseTrackerJS
9/20: Array Methods &amp; Local Storage - 20 VanillaJS Projects

This app allows the tracking of income and expenses, adding and removing items saved to local storage.

The project requires creation of a UI, displaying transaction items in the DOM, showing balance, expense and income totals.
The app also allows addition of new transactions reflected in the total, deleting items in the DOM as well as persistence to local storage.

This is the 9th project in Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JavaScript course on Udemy.com.

I am working through this project to revise concepts from B.Traversy's Modern JavaScript course, which I completed, and then to practice refactoring code using the React framework.
